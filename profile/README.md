The OPEA platform includes:

- Detailed framework of composable building blocks for state-of-the-art
  generative AI systems including LLMs, data stores, and prompt engines
- Architectural blueprints of retrieval-augmented generative AI component stack
  structure and end-to-end workflows
- A four-step assessment for grading generative AI systems around performance,
  features, trustworthiness, and enterprise-grade readiness
